For batching:
    Chain size 2


For Chain size and real chain and replication factors:
    The batch size was set to 5 for all experiments for FTC


For FTMB:
    Master delay was set to 3 us (the paper reports 4 us per PAL, but 1 us less in the configuration
     is considered for the overhead of the simulation)
    Output logger delay was set to 3 us instead of 3.5 us
